# Event Driven Applications

1. **Why is access control important?**

Access control keeps only the desired users able to access an application. This helps prevent malicious intent from unauthorized users.

2. **Describe an application that would need access control.**

Any app that needs a username and password to access to the user's information, where the user can change its own information, but can not access and modify others.

3. **What is a role used for?**

A role is used to determine what data a user or client can access.

4. **Why is role based access control more scalable than discretionary or mandatory access control?**

With hundreds of thousands of employees, security is more easily maintained by limiting unnecessary access to sensitive information based on each user's established role within the organization.

In *discretionary access control* permissions are set usually by the resource owner. In *mandatory access control* permissions are set by fixed rules based on policies and cannot be overridden by users.
## Vocabulary Terms

### Authorization
Authorization is the function of specifying access rights/privileges to resources, which is related to information security and computer security in general and to access control in particular.
### Role Based Access Control
*Role-based access control* (RBAC) is a method of restricting network access based on the roles of individual users within an enterprise. RBAC lets employees have access rights only to the information they need to do their jobs and prevents them from accessing information that doesn't pertain to them.
### Capabilities
What a User is allowed to do with the right permissions.
