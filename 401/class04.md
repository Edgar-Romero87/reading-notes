# Advanced Mongo/Mongoose


1. **Why would a developer choose to make data models?** 

Explores what data needs to be stored. We can then organize data in a structured way.
List relevant entities, Product, customer .
Name, price, Qty.
Relationship between entities.
Create table to present entities.
Create keys represent.

2. **What purpose do CRUD operations serve?** 

Crud: Create, Read, Update, Delete. These are the four basic operations in persistent storage. Each letter refers to the functions execute in relational db apps.

3. **What kind of database is Postgres? What kind of database is MongoDB?**

Postgres is an object- relational database.
MongoDb is a non-relational database management system.

4. **What is Mongoose and why do we need it?** 

Mongoose is an ODM library. It manages relationships between data, provides schema validations, and is used to translate between objects in code and the representation of those objects in MongoDB. {freecodecamp.org}.

5. **Describe how NoSQL Databases scale horizontally**

They add more instances to handle the work load. SQl scaling adds more power to handle the work load.

6. **Give one strong argument for and against NoSQL Databases**

SQL databases are better for multi-row transactions, Nosql are better for unstructured data like documents or JSON.

7. **Define three related pieces of data in a possible application. An example for a store application might be Product, Category and Department. Describe the constraints and rules on each piece of data and how you would relate these pieces to each other. For example, each Product has a Category and belongs in a Department.**

8. **Name 3 cloud-based NoSQL Databases**
Azure
AWS
MongoDB
