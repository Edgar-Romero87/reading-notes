# Routing

1. **Do child components have direct access to props/state from the parent?**

Yes, if a child has a prop that is because its parent provided that prop to the child.

2. **When a component “wraps” another component, how does the child component’s output get rendered?**

It will place the HTML generated by a matched route inside of a DOM node.
```
<Main>
  <Content />
</Main>
```
3. **Can a component, such as `<Content />`, which is a child also be used as a standalone component elsewhere in the application?**

Yes

4. **What trick can a parent use to share all `props` with it’s children**

You can use React.Children to iterate over the children, and then clone each element with new props (shallow merged) using React.cloneElement.

## Vocabulary Terms
### props.children
- It's one special prop provided by React to render something within a component whereas the component isn't aware ahead of time what it will be.

- A function that returns a React element. Unlike the prior two props, this will always be rendered, regardless of whether the route’s path matches the current location.

### Composition
The internals of a function in programming that need to be arranged in a way to get the desired output.
