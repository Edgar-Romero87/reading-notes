# Data Modeling & NoSQL Database


1. Why would a developer choose to make data models?

Data modeling is an essential step in the process of creating any complex software. It helps developers understand the domain and organize their work accordingly.

2. What purpose do CRUD operations serve?
In computer programming, create, read (aka retrieve), update, and delete **(CRUD)** are the four basic functions of persistent storage. Alternate words are sometimes used when defining the four basic functions of CRUD, such as retrieve instead of read, modify instead of update, or destroy instead of delete.

3. What kind of database is Postgres? What kind of database is MongoDB?

**PostgreSQL** is a powerful, open source object-relational database system that uses and extends the SQL language combined with many features that safely store and scale the most complicated data workloads.

**MongoDB** is a cross-platform document-oriented database program. Classified as a NoSQL database program, MongoDB uses JSON-like documents with optional schemas. 

4. What is Mongoose and why do we need it?
Mongoose is an object data modeling (ODM) library that provides a rigorous modeling environment for your data, enforcing structure as needed while still maintaining the flexibility that makes MongoDB powerful. 

5. Define three related pieces of data in a possible application. An example for a store application might be Product, Category and Department. Describe the constraints and rules on each piece of data and how you would relate these pieces to each other. For example, each Product has a Category and belongs in a Department.

## Vocabulary terms
### database
A database is an organized collection of data, generally stored and accessed electronically from a computer system.
### data model
A data model is an abstract model that organizes elements of data and standardizes how they relate to one another and to the properties of real-world entities.
### CRUD
CRUD is an acronym that comes from the world of computer programming and refers to the four functions that are considered necessary to implement a persistent storage application: create, read, update and delete.
### schema
The database schema of a database is its structure described in a formal language supported by the database management system (DBMS). The term "schema" refers to the organization of data as a blueprint of how the database is constructed (divided into database tables in the case of relational databases).
### sanitize
Data sanitization is the process of deliberately, permanently and irreversibly removing or destroying the data stored on a memory device to make it unrecoverable.
### Structured Query Language (SQL)
Structured Query Language (SQL) is a specialized language for updating, deleting, and requesting information from databases. SQL is an ANSI and ISO standard, and is the de facto standard database query language. 
### Non SQL (NoSQL)
NoSQL, which stands for “not only SQL,” is an approach to database design that provides flexible schemas for the storage and retrieval of data beyond the traditional table structures found in relational databases.
### MongoDB
MongoDB is a cross-platform document-oriented database program. Classified as a NoSQL database program, MongoDB uses JSON-like documents with optional schemas. 
### Mongoose
MongoDB is a cross-platform document-oriented database program. Classified as a NoSQL database program, MongoDB uses JSON-like documents with optional schemas. 
### record
A data entry in a SQL style database. 
### document
 A data entry in a NoSQL style database.
### Object Relation Mapping (ORM)
Object-relational mapping (ORM, O/RM, and O/R mapping tool) in computer science is a programming technique for converting data between incompatible type systems using object-oriented programming languages. This creates, in effect, a "virtual object database" that can be used from within the programming language.
