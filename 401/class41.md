# React Native

1. **Compare and Contrast Redux Toolkit with Redux “Ducks”**

Redux Toolkit provides some tools that abstract over the setup process and handle the most common use cases, as well as include some useful utilities that will let the user simplify their application code.

Ducks is a modular pattern that collocates actions, action types and reducers.

2. **What is the principle advantage of Redux Toolkit?**

The Redux Toolkit package is intended to be the standard way to write Redux logic. 

## Vocabulary Terms
### Redux toolkit slices
createSlice(): accepts an object of reducer functions, a slice name, and an initial state value, and automatically generates a slice.
### Namespace
Set of signs (names) that are used to identify and refer to objects of various kinds. A namespace ensures that all of a given set of objects have unique names so that they can be easily identified.
