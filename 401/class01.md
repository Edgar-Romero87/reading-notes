# Node Ecosystem, TDD, CI/CD

1. **Why would you want to run JavaScript code outside of a browser?**

Running JavaScript inside a browser means you are interacting with Web UI (HTML and CSS components) which is displayed on a user's screen. Running JavaScript without/outside a browser means you are using node. js technology to execute your JavaScript code.

2. **What is the difference between a module and a package?**

A module is a single file (or files) that are imported under one import and used. e.g. A **package** is a collection of **modules** in directories that give a package hierarchy.

3. **What does the node package manager do?**

npm , short for **Node Package Manager**, is two things: first and foremost, it is an online repository for the publishing of open-source Node. js projects; second, it is a command-line utility for interacting with said repository that aids in package installation, version management, and dependency management.

4. **Provide code snippets showing 3 different ways to export a function from a node module**


## Vocabulary Terms
### Ecosystem
The JavaScript ecosystem is a collection of software packages, libraries, and other resources that facilitate development as they integrate with each other.
### Node.js
Node.js is an open-source, cross-platform, JavaScript runtime environment that executes JavaScript code outside a web browser.
### V8 Engine
V8 is Google’s open source high-performance JavaScript and WebAssembly engine, written in C++. It is used in Chrome and in Node.js, among others. 
### Module
A module is a software component or part of a program that contains one or more routines. One or more independently developed modules make up a program. An enterprise-level software application may contain several different modules, and each module serves unique and separate business operations.
### Package
A package is one or more modules (libraries) grouped (or packaged) together. Packages are then combined to form a project.
### Node package manager (npm)
npm is a package manager for the JavaScript programming language. It is the default package manager for the JavaScript runtime environment Node.js. It consists of a command line client, also called npm, and an online database of public and paid-for private packages, called the npm registry.
### Server
The “server” is a web application server at a remote location that will process web requests and send pages to the client. Web applications can contain code that is processed on the client's browser or on the web server.
### Environment
The JavaScript specification calls that a host environment. A host environment provides own objects and functions additional to the language core. Web browsers give a means to control web pages. Node. js provides server-side features, and so on.
### Interpreter
The source code is passed through a program called a compiler, which translates it into bytecode that the machine understands and can execute. In contrast, JavaScript has no compilation step. Instead, an interpreter in the browser reads over the JavaScript code, interprets each line, and runs it.
### Compiler
JavaScript is an interpreted language, not a compiled language. A program such as C++ or Java needs to be compiled before it is run. The source code is passed through a program called a compiler, which translates it into bytecode that the machine understands and can execute.
