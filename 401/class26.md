2. **Whatâ€™s the difference between a framework and a library?**

- Frameworks AND libraries are code written by someone else that is used to help solve common problems.
- When you use a library, you are in charge of the flow of the application. You are choosing when and where to call the library
- When you use a framework, the framework is in charge of the flow. It provides some places for you to plug in your code, but it calls the code you plugged in as needed.
