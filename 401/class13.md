# Bearer Authorization

1. **Write the following steps in the correct order:**

  * Register your application to get a client_id and client_secret
  * Receive authorization code
  * Ask the client if they want to sign in via a third party
  * Make a request to a third-party API endpoint
  * Receive access token
  * Make a request to the access token endpoint
  * Redirect to a third party authentication endpoint.

2. **What can you do with an authorization code?**

The authorization code is a temporary code that the client will exchange for an access token. The code itself is obtained from the authorization server where the user gets a chance to see what the information the client is requesting, and approve or deny the request

3. **What can you do with an access token?**

Access tokens are the thing that applications use to make API requests on behalf of a user. The access token represents the authorization of a specific application to access specific parts of a user's data. Access tokens must be kept confidential in transit and in storage.

4. **Whatâ€™s a benefit of using OAuth instead of your own basic authentication?**

OAuth works based on tokens and authorization.
