# Structures of web pages with HTML:

## HTML Basics and Structure

The HTML code is made up of characters that live inside angled brakets these are called **elements**. Elements are usually made up of two **tags**, an opening tagg and a closing tagg.(The closing tagg has an extra froward slash in it.)

*HTML pages are a text document. To learn HTML you need to know what tags are available for you to use, what they do, and where they can go.
An HTML element contains a meaning and tells the browser something about the purpose of the information within its opening and closing tags.
Tags usually come in pairs. The opening tag denotes the start of a piece of content; the closing tag denotes the end.
Atributtes requiere a name and value.*



# MarkUp

- Older browsers that do not undertand HTML5 elements need to be told wich elements are block-level elements.
- To make HTML5 work in Internet Explorer 8 (and older versions of IE), extra JavaScript is needed wich is available free from Google.

# The ABC of programing

## JavaScript 
 
JavaScript is written in plain text (just like HTML & CSS style sheets), but they have the .js extension. It is the best to keep JavaScript code on it own javascript file.
The HTML  < script >  element is used in HTML pages to tell the browser to load the Javascript file (rather than the < link > element can be used to load a CSS file). Web developers usually talk about 3 languages that are used to create web pages HTML,CSS and JavaScript.

HTML - Content layer ( .html files)
CSS - Presentation layer ( .css files)JavaScript - Behavior layer ( .js files)

If you view the source code of the page in the browser,  the JavaScript will not have change the HTML, because the script works with the model of the web page that the browser has created.Variable ( var ) before you used a variable, you need to announce that you want to use it. This involves creating the variable and giving it a name. Programmers say that you 'declare' the variable.
