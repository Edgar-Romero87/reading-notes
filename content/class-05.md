# HTML Images; CSS Color & Text

## Images
There are many reasons why you might want to add an image to a web page: you  might want to include a logo, photograph, illustration, diagram, or chart.
- The < img > elemnt is used to add images to a web page.
- You must always specify an **src** attribute to indicate the source of an image and an **alt** to describe the content of an image.
- You should save images at the size you will be using them on the web page and in the appropriate format.
- Photographs are best saved as JPEGs; illustrations or logos that use flat colors are better saved as GIFs.
- Three rules for creating images:
1. Save images in the right format.
2. Save images at the right size.
3. Measure images in pixeles. 

## Color
- Color can really bring you pages to life, but also helps convey the mood and evokes reactions.
- There are three ways to specify color in CSS: RGB values, hex codes, and color names.
- Color pickers can help you find the color you want.
- It is important to ensure that there is enough contrast between any text and the background color (otherwise people will not be able to read your content).
- CSS3 has introduced an extra value for RGB color to indicate opacity. It is known as RGBA.
- CSS3 also allows you to specify color as HSL values, with an optional opacity value. It is known as a HSLA.

## Text 
The properties that allow you to control the appareance of a text can be split in two groups:
- Those that directly affect the font and its appareance (including the typeface, whether is regular, bold or italic, and the size of the text).
- Those that would have the same effect on the text no matter what font you were using(including the color of the text and the spacing between letters and words).

### Typeface Terminology
 - Serif: serifs fonts have extra details on the ends of the main strokes of the letters.
 - Sans-serif: this fonts have straight ends to letters, and therefore have a much cleaner design.
 - Monospace: every letter in a monospace(for fixed-width) font is the same width.(Non-monospace fonts have different widths).
- Cursive: cursive fonts either have joining strokes or the other cursive characteristics, such as handwriting styles.
- Fantasy: this fonts are usually decorative fonts and are often used for titles. They're not designed for long bodies of text.

There is a limited choice of fonts that you can assume most people will have installed.
If you want to use wider range of typefaces there are several options, but you need to have the right license to use them.
You can control the space between lines of text, individual letters, and words. Text can also be aligned to the left, right, center, or justified. It can also be indented.
You can use pseudo-classes to change the style of an element when a user hovers over or clicks on text, or when they have visited a link.
