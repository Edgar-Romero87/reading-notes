[Why diversity matters to your tech company](https://www.usatoday.com/story/tech/columnist/2015/07/21/why-diversity-matters-your-tech-company/30419871/)
 
- In 2014, 70% of the employees in top tech companies in Silicon Valley (Facebook, Google, Twitter, etc) were male.
  - In technical roles, only around 10% of the workforce was female.

- The ratio of men and women in computer science approached parity in the 1970s and 1980s - and 37% of computer science grads in 1984 were women.
- By 2016, the number was only 18%.

  - Huge dip beginning in the mid-1980s that has continued to today.
## Marketing Games and the Tech Industry
- A large factor may be the use of early computers for gaming.
  - Games were marketed specifically to boys at the time.
  - This included games on computer, along with other consoles.
- A huge video game crash/recession in 1983 cause a massive drop in the market in the US (thanks to a flood of low-quality games that reduced consumer confidence).
  - End result: Industry was essentially rebuilt/marketed towards the small remaining audience (aka - mostly boys).
- "Game Boy", etc - lots of factors contributed to create a chicken-and-egg cycle of targeted marketing.
  - Reinforced the idea that gaming was for boys only.
  - Huge popularity of the Nintendo Game Boy in "saving" the industry.
- This problem contributed to a widening gap in experience between young men and women with games and technology.
  - "Snowball" effect of fewer women testing into advanced computer science programs at the university level in the 1990s.
  - Narrative around advertising technology needs to change (still aimed primarily at men).
- Male-dominated culture in the technology field makes for an isolating environment for female employees and specialists.
## Why Diversity Matters to Your Tech Company
- Diverse teams are smarter and more creative.
- Diverse companies perform better.
- Companies are losing out on great talent by not diversifying.
- Diverse companies can better serve and represent a diverse user base.
- Can help to break down existing social inequalities.
