## Lists, Tables & Forms

- In addition to the CSS properties covered in other chapters with work with the contents of all elements, there are several others that are specifically used to control the appearance of list, tables, and forms.
List markers can be given different appearances using the **list-style-type** and **list-style** image properties.  
Table cells can different borders and spacing in different browsers, but there are properties you use to control them and make them more consistent.
Forms are easier to use if the form controls are vertically aligned using CSS.

## JS Book: Events

- Events are the browser’s  way to indicating when something has happened (such as when a page has finished loading or a button has been clicked).
- Binding is the process of stating which event you are waiting to happen, and which element you are waiting for that event to happen upon.
- When an event occurs on an element, it can trigger a JavaScript function. When this function then changes the web page in some way, it feels interactive because it has responded to the user.
- You can use event delegation to monitor for events that happen on all of the children of an element.
- The most commonly use events are W3C DOM events , although there are others in the HTML5 specifications as well as browsers-specific events.
